Hello, I'm Yan Sandman, an Incident Responder & Security Consultant at [Tetrisponse](https://tetrisponse.io){:target="_blank"}. After working hours, you can find me delving into Offensive Security, exploring both attack and defense strategies in AWS, and engaging in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. When I'm away from my keyboard, I'm likely at my local Muay Thai gym, training hard.
