## About This Blog
This blog is where I share the cool things that I'm learning, researching, and developing.<br>
It is mostly about offensive security, but it can cover other topics as well.

Hello, I'm Yan Sandman, a Security Engineer at Go Global Travel, a Yanolja Cloud company.
Previously, I worked as an Incident Responder and Security Consultant.
Nowadays, I am mostly interested in Windows development and web application security,
which is what I spend most of my time doing.
When I'm not behind a keyboard, you'll probably find me at my local Muay Thai gym.
