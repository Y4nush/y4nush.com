My name is Yan Sandman. I am an Incident Responder & Security Consultant at <a href="https://tetrisponse.io" target="_blank">Tetrisponse</a>.<br>After hours, I dive into Offensive Security, exploring both attacks and defenses in AWS, and tackling CTFs.<br> And if I'm not in front of a keyboard, then I'm probably at my Muay Thai gym, training.
